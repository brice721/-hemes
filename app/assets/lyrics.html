    "Forgive And Forget"<br>
    <br>
    I feel like a runaway<br>
    Seeing the light of day<br>
    For the first time, I'm drawing the line<br>
    It's hard to care when you know it all<br>
    In slow motion I watch you fall<br>
    Like you're blind, thoughts poison the mind<br>
    I always bend when it comes to you<br>
    I think you'll change, but ya never do<br>
    You never do, I enable you<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget<br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Wish that I could say this to your face<br>
    Something different, something brave<br>
    Wish I would, but I never could<br>
    I feel you slowly pulling me in<br>
    I try to help, but it's sink or swim<br>
    And you're a weight, there's comfort in pain<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget<br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You've drained all the love I had<br>
    All I had for you<br>
    Yeah you've drained all the love I had<br>
    All I had for you<br>
    All I had for you<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget<br>
    Let me down, let me down like only you know how<br>
    Shut me out, shut me out, forgive and forget<br>
    Forgive and forget
